# Hospital-Data-Insights-with-SQL
This project involved writing and executing 10 real-world SQL queries to extract actionable insights from hospital operations data, including:
  Total number of patients across hospitals
  Department-wise patient analysis
  Monthly and daily medical expense trends
  City-wise patient distribution
  Longest patient stay duration
  Most and least performing departments
This project helped sharpen my understanding of SQL concepts like:
GROUP BY, ORDER BY, DATE_PART, JOIN, LIMIT, and AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS
Real-life reporting use cases for hospital administration & performance tracking
 Grateful for this step forward in my data analytics journey. Looking forward to building more!
 Feedback and suggestions are always welcome
